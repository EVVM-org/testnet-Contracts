3. SHARE-ALIKE REQUIREMENTS

3.1 Scope

If you create a Derivative Work and engage in Triggering Distribution, you
must publicly release that Derivative Work under this same license.

3.2 Definitions

"Derivative Work" means any modification, enhancement, or work based on the
software that:
  - Alters, adds, or removes functionality of the original code
  - Incorporates substantial portions of the original source code
  - Creates new components that depend on or interface with the original
    software

Derivative Work does NOT include:
  - Configuration files or parameters
  - Plugins or extensions that use only public APIs
  - Works that merely link to or use the software as a library without
    modification

"Triggering Distribution" means:
  - Making the Derivative Work available to any third party (whether by
    download, hosting, or other means)
  - Using the Derivative Work to provide services accessible to third parties
  - Deploying the Derivative Work in production environments accessible to
    others

3.3 Publication Requirements

Within 90 days of first Triggering Distribution, you must:

  1. Publish source code on a publicly accessible platform (e.g., GitHub,
     GitLab, Codeberg)

  2. Include this license with the published code

  3. Provide clear attribution identifying:
     - The original work (EVVM)
     - MATE Labs Inc. as the original licensor
     - A description of your modifications

  4. Ensure accessibility - the code must remain publicly available for at
     least 3 years

3.4 Internal Use Exception

You are NOT required to publish Derivative Works that:
  - Remain internal to your organization
  - Are not distributed to third parties
  - Are not used to provide services to external users

However, once you engage in Triggering Distribution, the 90-day publication
requirement begins.
